# 🎨 ColorSchemeGen – Project 8

**ColorSchemeGen** is a responsive and interactive color scheme generator that lets users pick a base color and choose from different scheme modes (monochrome, analogic, complement, triad, etc.). It fetches color palettes from the [The Color API](https://www.thecolorapi.com/) and allows users to copy color HEX codes with one click.

This project was **completely designed and built by me**, including the layout, functionality, and dark mode logic.

## ✅ My Contributions

This project is **100% hand-coded and designed by me**.  
I built it from scratch to practice:

- Working with external APIs  
- Writing clean and reusable DOM code  
- Implementing a dark/light theme toggle  
- Using modern JavaScript (fetch, async behavior)  
- Improving UI/UX with hover/copy effects

## 📦 Future Improvements

- Add saved palettes functionality (local storage)
- Enable exporting palettes as JSON or PNG
- Add hover tooltip when HEX code is copied
- Keyboard accessibility improvements
